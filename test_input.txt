Egyptology is an academic discipline that specialises in the study of ancient Egypt. It focuses on the archaeology, language, literature, history, religion, and art of that culture, but in recent decades the geographical scope of the field has been expanded to include research into Nubia (modern northern Sudan), which maintained close links with Egypt and had cultural affinities with it for several millennia.

Academic Egyptology can be said to have begun with the decipherment of important portions of the hieroglyphic script by Champollion in 1822; however, before Champollion Cambridge alumnus Thomas Young made important breakthroughs in the run-up to decipherment. It was only in the very late 19th and the early 20th century that Egyptology developed into a programme of study in its own right in several European and American universities. Egyptology is usually embedded within larger departments that either focus on Archaeology, Near Eastern topics more broadly, or Classics. In Cambridge, Egyptology is part of Archaeology and is taught as a stand-alone track within the Archaeology course.
